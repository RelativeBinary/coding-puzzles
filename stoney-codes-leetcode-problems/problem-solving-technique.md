# Process for problem solving I use in leetcode
## Read the problem twice to understand it (ask clarifying questions)
- Do the numbers include negatives? 
- Do the numbers range into infinity? 
- Are the arrays sorted?
... to continue this list

## Try think basically of different ways to solve the problem
- Think and verbalise solutions 
- Brute force approach to get started
- flow chart of data moving 
- plain english
- technical language - "init int and assign val of 5, loop and iterate by 1 untill val is over 10"
- numbered list of steps - 1. init var max to first element 2. etc 3. etc 6. return result

## Think e2e of the best solutions
- "If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 mins thinking about the problem and 5 min thinking about solutions" - Albert Einstien


## Write the algorithm from patterns in drawing
- Pen to paper drawing out solutions and walking through the problem
- Jot down pseudocode 

## Code it out
- literally

## Try and Improve it once you think you're finished
- think of faster solutions with different approaches 
- this could be cleaner code, different implementations of those different approaches
- divide and conquor
- Greedy - making the best choice at each step
- Dynamic programming - solve sub-problems and store rersults to avoid recomputation (e.g. Fiboncci series)
- Recomputation - calculating the same value multiple times unnecessarily similar to Dynamic programming
- Back tracking - (Soduku solver, N-Queens problem)

## Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly)
 - check leetcode but avoid non-readable answers
